# User Management App

A simple User Management app for creating and editing the users and Groups.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run Server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run server
   ```
   Will run mock json-server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) that frontend connects to it for apis.

And then run frontend app in other Terminal:

3. **Run Frontend in Development Mode:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

   The page will reload if you make edits, and lint errors will be displayed in the console.


### Implementation Decisions

I chose to use `React.js`, `Typescript`, `React-Query` and `Mui` for fast development.
